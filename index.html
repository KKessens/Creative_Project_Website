      <p class="introtext">
        Food has always been a big part of my life. I love trying new things and
        I’ve never been a picky eater (except for cheese). The foods I’ve eaten
        often have a story behind them, especially if it’s something new. Below
        are foods that I thought had an interesting context, whether it’s
        because I was in a new place, I wanted to try something new, or some
        other reason.

          Kansas City is known as the haunted house capital of the world. Being
          from there, I’ve visited them a few times. In 2018, I visited the
          Beast, one of the more famous houses, which had a line that stretched
          for almost two blocks. In the meantime, we got some fried Oreos to
          try. I couldn’t finish all of them, even though there were only four,
          because of all the salt and sugar. This is a picture of one of the
          leftovers.

        <p class="imagecaption">
          I never cared much for my high school cafeteria's food. The portions
          were small with a scarce amount of flavor. However, there was one item
          on the menu that almost everyone agreed was the best, the Asian Bowl.
          It was just fried rice with orange chicken but everyone looked forward
          to it on Fridays. Looking back, it probably wasn’t that good, but
          since everyone was so hungry by lunchtime it was put on an inflated
          pedestal.

          Every year, my family and I go to Colorado to ski. Usually we go to
          Keystone, but in 2020 we instead went to Breckenridge. On the trip,
          however, I got sick and wasn’t sure if I would be able to ski. Usually
          when I’m sick, I eat as much food as I can hoping that I’ll feel
          better the next day. I tried that here where I ordered a double bison
          bacon burger, the biggest thing on the menu. The waitress was shocked
          when I finished the whole thing. The next day I woke up and felt
          normal. This was in the earlier stages of the pandemic, but I don’t
          think I caught COVID since I remember how rich the burger was.

        <p class="imagecaption">
          My mom’s from Barcelona, so we usually visit there annually to catch
          up with family. I’m from Kansas, which makes it hard to appreciate
          seafood. Whenever I go to Spain, I try to eat as much as I can. This
          was my first time eating a fish served like this, since I was used to
          eating fish that had already been cut. However, the taste was
          magnitudes richer than anything I’d had in Kansas and one of my
          favorite fishes that I’ve had.

          Chicago was a city that I often passed through while visiting
          colleges. Everytime I did, I’d always get deep dish pizza. I have a
          large appetite that makes it difficult for any single meal to
          completely fill me up. Deep dish pizza is an exception, making it
          something I always get whenever I have the chance.

        <p class="imagecaption">
          Earlier I mentioned how I visit Spain annually to catch up with my
          family. My favorite food from Spain is Paella, which makes sense given
          how much I love seafood. Everything in it is made from some sort of
          seafood, whether it's the sauce, mussels, or shrimp. I had the paella
          shown in this picture right next to a beach with almost my entire
          extended family.

          I’ve been to Disney World three times, with my favorite part being
          Galaxy’s Edge, an entire area dedicated to Star Wars. I’ve been a fan
          of Star Wars for as long as I can remember and as I’ve gotten older
          I’ve only grown to like it more. This drink was one that I had in the
          Star Wars based cantina and I remember it as being one of the most
          unique and exciting moments of that trip.

          I started fencing when I was seven and have been doing it ever since.
          In 2023, I went to Denver to fence in the Junior Olympics. Afterwards,
          I went out with my mom and my second cousins to get Sushi. I don’t get
          to see my second cousins very often so it was fun to go out and have
          some food with them.

        <p class="imagecaption">
          Ask any of my friends and they’ll tell you how much I love dessert and
          sweets. At the top of my pyramid is this: the Cinnabon Cinnamon Swirl
          Cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory. I had this after one of my
          brother's tennis tournaments in downtown Kansas City with my family
          and grandparents. I’ll never forget how this tasted. It was a blend of
          every flavor that I love: sweets, cinamon, cream cheese, whipped
          cream, and caramel. Amazing.

          When it comes to my favorite restaurants in Madison, two immediately
          come to my mind: The Globe and Estacion Inka. Usually, I go to Inka
          and always get the same thing: Pollo Tropical with double chicken and
          cilantro rice. Earlier I mentioned how I have a huge appetite and this
          always leaves me feeling satisfied. The chicken is always perfectly
          cooked making it one of the best chickens I’ve had. I always eat here
          after an exam, if I’m feeling too lazy to make something, or if I just
          want some good food. No matter what, I always feel better after eating
          here.

        <p class="imagecaption">
          Living in an apartment instead of a dorm meant that I needed to start
          making my own food. The first thing that I decided to make was
          spaghetti with ground beef. In this particular meal, I had some corn
          that I bought at the farmers market. Spaghetti is one of the more
          common foods that I make since it's easy to add whatever I want.
          However, this was the first time that I made it in my apartment so I
          remember this meal fondly.

          My freshmen year, I was excited when I heard UW-Madison had a fencing
          club. I immediately joined and made some close friends. In October of
          2024, we went to a tournament at Northwestern where we went out to eat
          in Chicago. We all did pretty well and went to Chinatown for some Dim
          Sum. The food was amazing and I can’t wait to go back next year.

          I have the same roomate now as I did last year. We immediately got
          along and have been close friends since. We always talked about making
          steaks while in our dorm room and now that we had an apartment, we
          finally got around to it. We also made some fried rice to go with it.
          It was lots of fun and the steak turned out well.
